            <h3 id="iphone_not_charging">iPhone not charging</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Lint easily gets inside the charge port,
                        and can be packed down overtime from plugging in the charging cable.
                        Use a paperclip or similar tool to gently scrape
                        the charge port for debris. Continue gently scraping until all of
                        the lint is removed and test your iPhones charge function.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The charge port may have been exposed to liquid, even a 
                        single raindrop can cause a buildup of corrosion inside
                        the charge port! If your iPhone is wireless charging capable, test 
                        to see if it can take a charge wirelessly.
                    </li>

            <h3 id="computer_slow">Computer running slowly</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The macOS operating system naturally over time builds up junk files and
                        corruption that can slow the system down. You can find
                        a built-in Disk Utility application located in the Utilities folder
                        in the Applications list. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Open the <a href="./resources.html#disk_utility">Disk Utility</a> app to run First Aid on the drive to evaluate
                        the health of the drive and macOS, as well as repair any corrupted files.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <h3 id="malware_infection">Malware Infection</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In the past, Apple devices were robust in their ability to
                    prevent malicious software and bad actors from gaining access
                    to the operating system. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case
                    as new viruses and malware are being engineered every day. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you suspect your device has been exposed to or infected with malware,
                    we suggest downloading and running an anti-malware tool called MalwareBytes.
                    MalwareBytes is highly effective at detecting and removing any known malicious 
                    software present on your device. This tool has a 
                    free trial period, and can accessed from our <a href="./resources.html#malware_removal">resources</a> page.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="liquid_spill">Liquid Spill</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Liquid spills and device liquid exposure can happen to anyone. When any type of liquid gets on the electrical
                    and metal components inside your Apple device, a substance called corrosion can start forming on the components
                    immediately. This occurs when the negative ions present in the liquid begin reacting with the metal and causing
                    the metal to ionize, or breakdown, resulting in the formation of this greenish-white substance. These small components are very delicate, and are connected through electrical 
                    circuits in such a way that even a small area of corrosion involving one or two chips can prevent all down-stream 
                    processes to fail and render your device unusable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Often times areas that have been exposed to liuqid and have accumulated corrosion can be cleaned to restore normal
                    functionality to the liquid exposed device. If the corrosion is removed and these small electrical components have not been
                    damaged or burnt to a point of failure, the capacity of the electrical components to send and receive electrical signals, and properly
                    support device function can be restored.

            </ul>
            <h3 id="dirty_device">Dirty or dusty machines</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Folks often are not sure of the best way to clean the display of their Apple devices. We recommend
                    using a high-value isopropyl alcohol wipe or solution (70% - 91%) to gently clean the display, and 
                    a micro-fiber cloth for drying it off and buffing out any remaining fingerprints.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Almost every Apple computer contains one to two fans. Primarly, fans will push hot air out 
                    of the machine vents to help the internal components maintain a normal temperature and prevent 
                    them from getting too hot. However, fans also pull dust and dirt into the machine, and cause an 
                    abnormal amount of buildup on their blades as well as the other internal components. I have seen 
                    fans fully packed with dust and debris that has built up over time, and device owners who 
                    were not aware of this possibility. We highly recommend regularly removing the dust and debris 
                    from the inside of your machine. If you are comfortable opening your device, vacuum it out regularly 
                    to prevent this type of build-up. We also offer device cleaning services which include full device disassembly and careful vacuumming and dusting of each component 
                    to restore the components to their original clean state.
